## Imitation-learning-project

## Tasks for this week
- [ ] Continue reading
- [ ] Go through the LBC code base
- [ ] Identify potential schemes for combination

## General Outline
The project aims to solve/build a single research idea by balancing its theory with empirical evaluation. We hope to begin by gaining intuition about the problem and addressing it on a simple toy task. The method can then be extended to non-trivial robot control tasks in order to compare its efficacy with baseline algorithms. 

A longer list of papers is available [here](https://csc2541-f18.github.io/).

## Distribution of Tasks
As discussed, we can all pick one algorithm to implement and improve on a small task. In case our improvements work, we will apply these on new tasks and finalise results. Upon completion we will package our code base and distribute duties for report and presentation.
