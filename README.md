## Imitation-learning-project

## Updates

*Feb 22*- Added custom utilities to `utils.py` with CNN Policies in `DDPG.py` and `TD3.py`.   
*Feb 18*- [`IL code base`](IL-base/) is available. Refer to README and start programming.  
*Feb 16*- Proposal is complete. Midterm report due March 10.  

## General Outline
The project aims to solve/build a single research idea by balancing its theory with empirical evaluation. We hope to begin by gaining intuition about the problem and addressing it on a simple toy task. The method can then be extended to non-trivial robot control tasks in order to compare its efficacy with baseline algorithms.
