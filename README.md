## Imitation-learning-project

## General Outline
The project aims to solve/build a single research idea by balancing its theory with empirical evaluation. We hope to begin by gaining intuition about the problem and addressing it on a simple toy task. The method can then be extended to non-trivial robot control tasks in order to compare its efficacy with baseline algorithms.
